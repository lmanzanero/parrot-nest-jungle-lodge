                        <p className="header col s12 light">The Parrot Nest Lodge is a truly unique tropical experience. Spending the night under a 100 foot guanacaste tree in a tree house is like nothing else! The lodge is surrounded on three sides by the Mopan River, so a refreshing swim in clear water is never far away and the wildlife of the area abound. Yes, parrots and toucans are in great number here, along with hundreds of other types of birds, making this an ideal location for bird watching. Coati, agouti, otter, and the giant green iguana are among the many animals which are regular visitors to our beautiful gardens which, though lush and exotic, are virtually mosquito free, a real bonus for those who love the great outdoors - and a good night's sleep.</p>

Though Spanish-speaking, everyone also speaks English. Located just outside the village, Parrot Nest consists of two tree houses and seven cabins, some with private bathrooms and others sharing two bathhouses. Children are welcome. Breakfast and dinner are served on the verandah of the main house. Dinners are generous, healthy, and fresh, and meals for vegetarians are provided on request. Clean drinking water is always available.</p>

                        <p className="header col s12 light">It's very easy and inexpensive to get around San Ignacio, making getting to the Nest quite simple. Buses to and from Belize City run frequently every day(usually every half hour), and drop you off in downtown San Ignacio. For a smoother ride that's door to door, a private shuttle is the way to go, and it only takes 2 hours(it costs between$35u and $65u pp). From San Ignacio, the best taxi rates are with the Bullet Tree Collectivo Taxis($1us pp to the village; $2.50 pp to the lodge) which can be found directly across the street from the entrance of Belize Bank. When heading into town for supplies, we glady drop people off in town.</p>
