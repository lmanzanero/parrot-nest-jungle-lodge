                        "A cute, comfy set of intimate treehouses on the bank of a river where you can watch the fireflies dance while you lounge in your hammock after a fantastic meal. Do not miss the owner's scrumptious omelet breakfasts, and delicious, hearty dinners. There isn't a restaurant in nearby San Ignacio that can compare. This place was a find, and easy on the American wallet. Close to the outdoor activities of the area it's a great homebase from which to explore the Eastern interior of Belize." -JenniRG <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com">Tripadvisor.com</a>

                        "Parrot Nest Lodge is a secluded jungle experience but only 3 miles away from San Ignacio. The sounds of nature will greet you first thing in the morning and last thing at night... The owners, Theo and Marcus, are wonderful hosts and Parrot Nest will feel like home to you very quickly... The Mopan river is right in the backyard, so you can enjoy a refreshing swim, or go river tubing with Marcus. This was a great experience - a way to chill while listening to the river and the birds." - Debbie <a  rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.debbiescaribbeanresortreviews.com" target="_blank">Debbies caribbean resort reviews.com</a>

                            "Words can not describe the way I feel about this place. Theo, Marcus, Kaite, and the girls, you are all amazing people. I have never met such friendly and helpful people in my life. This is definately a home away from home. If you are looking for a 5 star hotel, then you are in the wrong place. If you are looking for something quite and peaceful, with a friendly atmosphere then you are in the right place. Theo helped us book our tours. Im happy that she did because we got to meet one of the best tour guides around, Max. If you can tour with him, i would reccomend it. If there is anything at all that you need Theo and her family are more than willing to help you . Katie (Theo`s mom) was there, she was very helpful aswell, lots of knowledge. make sure you pick up one of her books while you are there. I am really enjoying them. I can not say enough about this place. Thank you again for everything and making us feel at home. - Stephanie Herman <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"href="http://www.tripadvisor.com">Tripadvisor.com</a>

                            "The Parrot Nest Lodge consists of several huts with thatched roofs that sit on 12 foot stilts amongst huge guanacaste trees in a 5 acre tropical plant just outside of San Ignacio in Belize. The lodge has one en-suite room and the rest share the ground floor open-air bathrooms that are very clean, but often house surprise insect visitors that you might not want to see in the shower. In fact the lodge, which is on the banks of the Mopan River, is surrounded by wildlife, especially parrots (hence the name) and over a hundred other types of birds. If bird-watching is not for you, you can also expect to see Coatis, agoutis, otters and giant iguanas and all number of aquatic life as you take a cool dip in the clear waters of the river." -Alessia Horwich World <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.worldreviewer.com" target="_blank">World reviewer.com</a>

It's a beautiful setting with gorgeous gardens and the mopan river just down a small hill. My favorite part of my stay would have to be dinner, the food is awesome, but not as awesome as the wonderful company and conversation.

We stayed in one of the tree houses. Every morning we awoke to sounds of birds singing outside our window. The area surrounding the lodge is gorgeous! We saw more wildlife while there then we did while taking tours through the jungle. Each evening we sat down with the rest of the guest for an unforgettable meal( Theo is one hell of a cook)and we shared stories of our 'adventures' that day. -onlyinalaska_10 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"href="http://www.tripadvisor.com">Tripadvisor.com</a>

A beautiful view of the Mopan river in Belize. Only a short cab ride in to San Ignacio. A jewel in the Cayo district of Belize. Canoeing the caves and exploring the Mayan ruins of Tikal and Caracol.
        I'd give this a ranking with any jungle lodge of the Amazon!!!! Way to go!!!!!" -Bill Zimkouski <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"href="http://www.unusualhotelsoftheworld.com">Unusual hotels of the world.com</a>
